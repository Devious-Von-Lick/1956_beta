  siam.1.t:0 "The Nonthaburi Speech"
  siam.1.d:0 "Pridi Banomyong, a member of the civilian wing of Khana Ratsadon, known for his radical ideas, sometimes close to Marxism, of land reforms, addressed today a speech in the city of Nonthaburi.\n"Dear people of Siam, our glorious revolution, which has made us transition from a decadent and outdated political system to a system where the people finally have their voice, seems to be undergoing a test today. I myself have noticed that within the same party from which I come, some elements would like to establish their own form of tyranny, with the difference that the King and the nobles would be replaced by Generals and soldiers. But I believe in the Siamese people, who will never let such a thing happen. We have defeated tyranny once, we shall defeat it again."\nMany believe that this speech was about Phraya Phahonphonphayuhasena, who became Prime Minister following a coup d'état against the former Prime Minister, Phraya Manopakorn Nititada, of whom Pridi was close, but who was accused of communism because of his reform plans. No one knows if this speech will have an impact or not, but we will have to keep an eye on Pridi"

  siam.2.t:0 "Radio Seriphaph"
  siam.2.d:0 "It seems that the Free Thai have managed to take control of a radio station in the north of the country, where they have the most control. They use it to broadcast their own radio, Radio Seriphaph, meaning "Radio Freedom", with virulent attacks against the regime, as well as a call to join them every time. Some of their broadcasts are also linked to the debate on how Siam should be reorganized once the government is defeated, where there is a clear schism between the Liberals and the Communists, who seem to be equal in terms of membership within the rebels."
  siam.2.a:0 "We Need To Shut It Down!"

  siam.3.t:0 "Ho-Chi-Minh's Invitation"
  siam.3.d:0 "Since the beginning of the process of drafting a new constitution for Siam, some members of the temporary government have expressed their admiration for the person of Ho-Chi-Minh, a famous Vietnamese revolutionary, whose struggle for Vietnam's independence has been compared many times to the struggle against Khana Ratsadon. Many have expressed their desire to be advised by the one considered to be the greatest and wisest Indochinese revolutionary.\nHowever, more moderate members expressed mistrust, citing the link between Ho and communism, and fearing that a visit on his part would lead a large part of the government and the population to want to adopt a revolution modelled on that of the Bolsheviks."

  siam.4.t:0 "The Red March"
  siam.4.d:0 "It would seem that the simple transition to a parliamentary system was not enough. While it was supposed to be just another Monday, the Communist Party of Siam made a gigantic call for a revolt against capitalism, encouraging the inhabitants to seize the means of production by themselves. Pridi Phonmayong, who has since become the main thinker of the Communist Party, addressed a major speech to the crowd, stating that Siam now belongs to the workers.\nSeni Pramoj, seeing the extent of the protests, but refusing to follow the communist system, was forced to resign, and it is said that he took a plane with his family to the United States. Phonmayong, said the Communist Party of Siam single party and announced the establishment of a new political system \"More suited to our revolution\""

  siam.5.t:0 "The Declaration of the Republic"

It is for freedom that they fought and sacrificed themselves, and it is for these values that we shall honour them. People of Siam, freedom has triumphed over the darkness of tyranny, and I am proud to announce that we will build a republic based on our values for which we have proven our courage\"."

  siam.6.t:0 "A Weapon Warehouse Raided!"
  siam.6.d:0 "During the night, one of our main weapons warehouses, located not far from Bangkok, was attacked by rebels, identified as belonging to the Free Thais. It would appear that most of the guards were killed discreetly, as the alarm was never triggered, which also implied that there had to be an ally among the guards. The warehouse was completely emptied, taking rifle and ammunition with them."
  siam.6.a:0 "This Does Not Bode Well..."

  siam.7.t:0 "A Letter From Pridi"
  siam.7.d:0 "One of the army generals went to Prime Minister Phot Phahonyothin to tell him of his fears about a potential infiltration of the army by anti-government revolutionaries. He claims to have found in one of the dormitories a message written by Pridi Banomyong. This message encouraged soldiers to peacefully oppose the government, declaring their refusal to be commanded by what they call "an adaptation of fascism".\nThe general suggested using this letter as a justification to arrest Pridi Banomyong for inciting disorder, and to try to prevent ideas of rebellion from spreading"

  siam.8.t:0 "The Sakhrai Incident"
  siam.8.d:0 "Last night, a police station in a village in the north-eastern district of Sakhrai was attacked by a gang of ten armed men. The two police officers present apparently disappeared, killed or abducted, and the attackers left the scene a few minutes later, according to a witness who had managed not to be seen. He says he heard one of the men complain about the absence of an official radio station.\nThe news of this attack provoked many reactions within the government, some thinking that they could have been inspired by Pridi Banomyong's call for resistance, which the authorities are still looking for but which remains unaccounted for. Rumours are circulating that a vast resistance network is being set up, and Phraya Phahonphonphayuhasena has announced his intention to increase the number of police officers in the region."

  siam.9.t:0 "The Free Thais"
  siam.9.d:0 "While it was only supposed to be one afternoon like any other, a very special message could be heard on military radio:\n"We are the Free Thai movement. The soldiers of Khana Ratsadon are traitors, who used the revolution to make their own tyranny prevail instead of that of the King. We want to bring justice and democracy to our nation, and we will not hesitate in any way to finally give the Siamese people freedom. If you are an ally of the government, you are our enemy. If you are against it, you are our ally. We do not want to hurt any innocent people, but to prevent our beautiful nation from falling into the trap of fascism. We have seen what happened in Italy, Germany or Hungary. Terror, hatred, fanaticism and despair reign. We want to avoid this fate for our beautiful country, and build a new government that would act with the intention of meeting the needs of the people, for we are the people."\nThe voice heard was none other than that of Direk Jayanama, another former member of the Khana Ratsadon's civilian wing, who had become one of the main critics of the manhunt against Pridi Banomyong. It seems that he has decided to join the latter in an attempt to bring down the government through a large-scale revolt. We are currently unaware of their numbers, and it seems that they are mainly hiding in the northeast of the country, making it difficult to track them down."

  siam.10.d:0 "What should have been a simple insurrection has turned into a real rebellion. Declaring that he had found a letter from the Prime Minister to several members of Khana Ratsadon, indicating his ambitions to abolish the monarchy in the coming months, Prince Aditya Dibabha, who had been regent on behalf of Rama VIII, made a great appeal to the rebellion to "all those still loyal to the king". Many thought it would be crushed in the same way as Prince Boworadet's 1933 rebellion, which had failed because the Bangkok garrisons refused to join him.\nBut this time it was not the case. The garrison immediately left to join the rebels, who were able to take control of Bangkok within a few hours.\nThe main members of the former government, in particular Phraya Phahonphonphayuhasena, the Prime Minister, and Plaek Phibunsongkhram, were arrested and are awaiting trial, and the Prince declared the abolition of the 1932 Constitution, and his intention to restore Rama VII as King of Siam, declaring his abdication invalid due to military pressure."

Two thirds of the militias attacked the city from the north, while the rest came from the east, with a small group apparently trying to attack from the ports using boats obtained as a result of a navy mutiny. Meanwhile, the government-loyal army, led by Plaek Phibunsongkhram, has deployed in the city, where a curfew has been decreed until further notice, and the aircraft is preparing to take off to provide reconnaissance support.

Prince Aditya Dibabha, Head of the Provisional Government, was also present and accompanied Rama VII until the coronation ceremony a few hours later.\nRama VII is therefore once again king of Siam, and has announced his intention to re-implement the reforms he had put in place before the 1932 coup, notably the Supreme Council, and his intention to set up greater decentralization of the administration."

  siam.13.d:0 "Officially, Siam has been a constitutional monarchy since the 1932 coup d'état, and the king continues to have some power over the government. But since the abdication of Prajadhipok, also known as Rama VII, following disagreement with the military who had become the main force of politics, Siam found itself without a king. His successor, Ananda Mahidol or Rama VIII, is only a child studying in Switzerland, and his regents have only a very limited influence. However, some members of the government fear that in the long term, the new king would risk putting batons in the wheels of the military again, and have therefore suggested abolishing the monarchy. But the abolition of an institution as important as the monarchy should not be taken lightly..."

Pridi Banomyong, leader of the revolutionaries, addressed a speech on the radio.\n\"Dear people of Siam, military tyranny is now behind us.
